        <h1>A Incredible, Clever Woman</h1>
        <p>A Horror Novel
          by Kevin Tilly Iffly
          What would you do if you knew there were tight-fisted fairies with shocking habits near the ones you love?
          The night of the holiday changes everything for Elizabeth Ramsbottom, a 80-year-old private detective from San Diego.
          One moment, she is discussing weapons with her kind wife, Stanley Nolan; the next, watching with horror as tight-fisted fairies attack each other.
          She knows these fairies came from Amsterdam but she can't prove it - at least not without some fluffy bees.
          The incredible, clever woman knows that her carefree life is over. She acquires some fluffy bees and is reborn as the hero who will save the world from tight-fisted fairies.
          However, Elizabeth finds herself troubled by her carefree ideals and becomes overwhelmed with moral questions. Will her conscience allow her to do whatever is needed to stop the tight-fisted fairies?
